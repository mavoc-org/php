# Example

An open source, MIT licensed app built with a custom PHP MVC backend framework and [TACE](https://www.agraddy.com/introducing-tace) for front end development. It is currently a very early alpha version of the software but the ultimate goal is to create a simple app. The original community can be found at [Example.com](https://www.example.com).

## Who
Example App is created by [Anthony Graddy](https://www.agraddy.com) to help solve a simple problem.

## What
Example is a simple app that solves a simple problem.

## When
Example is available now but it is a very early alphha release. If you would like to request additional features, please submit a new ticket in the DashboardQ Support system. Note that paying customers will receive higher priority.

## Where
Example is open source and can be installed on any server that supports modern PHP frameworks. The PHP used is very basic and should work with web hosts that support PHP 7.3 and above. It will probably work with older versions of PHP, but I'm not testing or guaranteeing anything for older versions of PHP.
